## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Order Recommendation:

1. **Start with Phase 1** (Core Functionality) - Most impactful for user experience
2. **Move to Phase 4** (UI/UX) - Quick wins that improve user experience
3. **Implement Phase 2** (API Integration) - Adds significant value
4. **Add Phase 3** (Additional Pages) - Nice-to-have features
5. **Finish with Phase 5** (Technical Improvements) - Polish and optimization

## ðŸ“Š Estimated Total Time: 13.5-17.5 days

Each phase can be worked on independently, and within each phase, sub-tasks can often be parallelized or tackled in different orders based on priority and dependencies.
